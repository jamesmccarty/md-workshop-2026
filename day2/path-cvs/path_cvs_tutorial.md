# Path CVs

This tutorial will introduce you to the concept of a path collective variable (CV). Biasing a path CV, you can enhance the sampling along a chosen path along the free energy surface. This is a powerfull approach for simulating complex reaction processes or structural transitions between two states where the endpoints are known.   

Once this tutorial is completed students will be able to:

- Generate a putative reaction path using `pathtools`.
- Prepare a PLUMED input file implementing a path collective variable (Path CV). 
- Perform a metadynamics simulation biasing the progress along the path and assess the sampling efficiency.
- Improve the sampling by performing two-dimensional metadynamics biasing both the progress along the path and the distance from the path.
