# Metadynamics

In this tutorial you will learn how to perform a metadynamics enhanced sampling simulation using PLUMED. We will use the alanine dipeptide molecule as a simple model system for exploring conformational transitions and free energy calculations.

Once this tutorial is completed students will be able to:

- Define and assess collective variables for enhanced sampling
- Run a metadynamics simulation using PLUMED
- Calculate free energies from a metadynamics simulation

Files to complete this tutorial can be accessed here:
[tutorial files](coming soon)

These files are already located on bigzam:
/opt/workshop/metadynamics/

## Getting Started

Use PuTTY to connect to bigzam as you did in previous [tutorials](../../day1/lj_fluid/lj_fluid_tutorial.md). Open PuTTY from the Window Start menu and enter `bigzam.local` for the Host Name. Login using the terminal using your username and password.

**Important**: Once connected to the workshop computer, set your environment variables by typing:

{% highlight git %}
source setup.sh
{% endhighlight %}

Copy the tutorial files by typing in the terminal:

In the terminal type:
{% highlight git %}
cp -r /opt/workshop/metadynamics/ ~/
{% endhighlight %}

This will copy the necessary tutorial files to your home directory on bigzam.

**Tip**: You can press the Tab key to automatically complete file and directory names. This can save time and help avoid typing errors.

Move into the using_restraints directory:

{% highlight git %}
cd ~/metadynamics
{% endhighlight %}

Within this directory you will find the following files:

- dialaA.pdb: A reference PDB structure file of the molecule
- alanine_dipeptide.gro: A GROMACS structure file (.gro)
- topol.top: A GROMACS topology file (.top)
- vacuum.mdp: A GROMACS parameter file (.mdp)
